# 👋 Hi, I'm Luke Smith

I'm a fullstack software engineer focused on making complex systems intuitive and accessible.

### 🛠️ What I'm Building
I'm currently working on **[Syncly](https://syncly.tech)** — a Solana-native tax platform that transforms raw blockchain data into clear, human-readable insights. I designed and deployed the backend with Python (FastAPI) and PostgreSQL, integrating Solana APIs and Stripe to help developers and traders simplify crypto reporting.

### 💼 Where I've Worked
- **Developer Relations Intern @ Marginfi**  
  Created SDK onboarding content, developer walkthroughs, and migrated their public docs to Sanity CMS. Helped improve developer adoption through ecosystem support and technical content.
  
- **Software Engineer Intern @ John Deere**  
  Built and maintained fullstack tools using Java, PostgreSQL, and AWS. Modernized legacy workflows and delivered production-grade backend services for data engineering teams.

### 💡 What I Care About
I love building developer-first tools that feel fast, clean, and intuitive. I'm especially interested in developer experience, product-led engineering, and making Web3 more accessible for everyone — not just power users.
